# wp-remove-rankmath-search

This is a simple plugin with no configration options. It removes the sitelinks searchbox structured data inserted by the RankMath plugin for WordPress. This is important if your WordPress website doesn't use search functionality, since having irrelevant structured data on your pages can have a negative SEO impact.

We use this plugin at [Bidwell Websites](https://bidwellwebsites.com) to ensure sites we build without search don't have this irrelevent structured data and potentially harming search rankings.
